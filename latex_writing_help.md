# LaTeX Writing Help

LaTeX is to a C compiler as Microsoft Word is to Matlab.
Microsoft Word and similar What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editors
need the user to only hit _print_ to get their document;
in the same way, a Matlab user needs only to hit _run_ to get
their results.

LaTeX, like a C compiler, must read in a user written text file,
have access to installed libraries, and finally
writes its result to file (`your_document.pdf` as opposed to
`your_compiled_exec.o`).

Below is a list of pointers and links to helpful websites and
documents to learn LaTeX:
