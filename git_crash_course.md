# Git Crash Course: _Basics on starting with Git and Github_

## What is git?
In short, `git` is a version management software. 
Alone, it provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) for a project
on a single machine;
when paired with github, 
it gains a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and 
allows machines connected to the internet to contribute to the same project.

## How does git work?
Git works by tracking changes (in the form of commits) to a repository.
Every commit can contain additions or deletions of text, files, or directories
along with a commit message;
the commit message is a comment of the changes made.
