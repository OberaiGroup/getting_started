# LaTeX Writing Help

LaTeX is to a C compiler as Microsoft Word is to Matlab.
Microsoft Word and similar What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editors
need the user to only hit _print_ to get their document;
in the same way, a Matlab user needs only to hit _run_ to get
their results.

LaTeX, like a C compiler, must read in a user written text file,
have access to installed libraries, and finally
writes its result to file (`your_document.pdf` as opposed to
`your_compiled_exec.o`).

Below is a list of pointers and links to helpful websites and
documents to learn LaTeX:

  * [This is a short write up how LaTeX works and thinks. 
    It also covers some of the history of the commands to help
    help explain why some thing are they way they are.][1]
  * [Sometimes you know the symbol you want to draw but don't know
    the name or command. This website lets you draw the symbol
    and gives you the command and package to use.][2]
  * [Sometimes it's hard to draw the symbol or you would 
    rather just copy it directly. This tool allows you 
    to do so.][4]
  * [_TikZ_ and _PGF Plots_ are two common graphics packages
    used in conjuction with LaTeX. This is a website of many
    examples.][3]
  * These are two lists of symbols available in LaTeX:
    1. [This is a shorter list of common symbols.][5]
    2. [This is a longer list of all available symbols in LaTeX.][6]
