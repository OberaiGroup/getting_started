# A (non-comprehensive) list of useful ML/DL resources
Below is a list of useful and *free* online machine learning/deep learning resources to get started with most of the projects of this group. Please keep in mind that due to dynamic and fast-paced nature of the field, some of these resources (specially the adanced topics) might not be as relavent as they're at the time of posting.

## Pre-requisites
Use these resources to brush-up your knowledge about linear algebra, probability, and statistics. One can easily skip these courses if they've good grasp over these subjects.

1. [Probability and Statistics (Stanford)](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/gse-yprobstat-probability-and-statistics): This self-paced course covers basic concepts in probability and statistics spanning over four fundamental aspects of machine learning: exploratory data analysis, producing data, probability, and inference.
2. [Linear Algebra (MIT)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/): One of the best linear algebra course. Taught by one and only prof. Gilbert Strang.

## Recommended courses
Use these courses to learn about basics and some advanced topics of modern day ML/DL.
1. [Machine learning (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) One of the most popular course on machine learning. Depending upon background, one may skip first two week's content. Important content: week 3,4,5,6. Week 7 onwards are interesting but not too useful.
2. [Convolution neural networks for visual recognition (Stanford)](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) Probably the *most useful* and *important* course in this list with nice mix of theory and code. Has nice warm-up exercise of numpy/python for the beginners. Lecture videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC1qU-LWwrF64f4QKQT-Vg5Wr4qEE1Zxk) (1-9 important). *Do check for the latest version of the course on course website.*

## Advanced resources
Use these resources if you're interested in some specific and/or advanced topics.
1. Reinforcement learning
   1. [Introduction to deep reinforcement learning (Deepmind)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/probabilistic-graphical-models) A relatively old one for a field like RL, but nice introductory course taught by the creater of Alpha Go.
   1. [Reinforcement learning bootcamp (Berkeley)](https://sites.google.com/view/deep-rl-bootcamp/lectures?fbclid=IwAR3p_GSDysSZN9I3ib43Z-F5CzdYKmkHwh9o_eabSLFw7aP648y0D4jDdqI) Workshop style videos starting from basics and going to some advanced topics.
2. [Deep generative models (Stanford)](https://deepgenerativemodels.github.io/) Interesting course for anyone interested in deep generative models including GANs, VAEs, Auto-regressive models etc.
3. [Probabilistic graphical models (Stanford)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/probabilistic-graphical-models) A nice course for anyone interested in probabilistic ML and graphical models.
4. [Neural networks for machine learning (UTorrento)](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/coursera_lectures.html) This is a relatively old course (around 2012) and some of the contents are now outdated, but contains some gold nuggets and is must for anyone deeply interested in understanding the evolution of many mdern day algorithms (taught by the legendary Jeff Hinton).
